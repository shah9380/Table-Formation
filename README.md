#Table Formation

This repository contains an example of an HTML table that displays different categories of items along with images, descriptions, and links.

## Introduction

The HTML code provided in this repository creates a table that showcases items from three categories: cars, watches, and shoes. Each category is displayed with an image, a description, and a link.

## Table Structure

The main structure of the table is defined using HTML elements. Here's how the table is structured:

![Header](https://github.com/shah9380/Table-Formation/assets/130676464/53a1c32d-31bc-489c-a156-c350e224139d)


- The table has a frame of "box," rules of "all," a border of "2," and cell padding of "4" and cell spacing of "5."
- The table has a <thead> section that contains a header row with three <th> (table header) cells: IMAGE, VISIT LINK, and DESCRIPTION.

  
- The <tbody> section contains rows that represent each category's information.

## Categories

### Cars

- The car category is displayed using the following HTML elements:
  - The `<tr>` element with a colspan of "3" to create a single-cell row spanning all three columns.
  - An `<img>` element displaying a car image.
  - A `<p>` element containing a description of the car.
  - An `<a>` element for the "VISIT LINK" column.

- The watch category is displayed using similar HTML elements as the car category.
  - An `<img>` element showing a watch image.

### Insights Gained

While working on this project and creating the HTML table with different categories of items, I've gained valuable insights into web development and HTML. Some key takeaways include:

- **Understanding HTML Structure:** By creating the table layout, I've deepened my understanding of HTML's structural elements like `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, and `<th>`.
- **Utilizing Image Elements:** Incorporating `<img>` elements allowed me to grasp how to display images on a webpage, adjusting their size with attributes like `height` and `width`.
- **Organizing Content:** The use of `<th>` for table headers and `<td>` for data cells has provided practical experience in organizing and presenting content in a structured manner.
- **Link Integration:** Working with `<a>` elements for links helped me learn how to create clickable elements for additional information or external resources.
- **Styling and Presentation:** Experimenting with attributes like `border`, `cellpadding`, and `cellspacing` gave me insights into how to enhance the visual presentation of a table.
- **Image Accessibility:** I've gained awareness of the importance of providing meaningful `alt` attributes for images, ensuring accessibility for users who rely on screen readers.

This exercise has not only improved my HTML skills but also increased my confidence in crafting web content that is visually appealing and user-friendly.
